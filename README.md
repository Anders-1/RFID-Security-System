# RFID-Security-System
An RFID Security System based on the Raspberry Pi Pico (revised from the Zero to Pico).

Version History:

<!--If you put two spaces after a line it makes a new line but not as big ü§∑-->

V1. RPi Zero  
V2. RPi Pico  
V3. :shipit: :trollface: :octocat:

TODO:¬†

- [X] Add green light

- [ ] Add startup checker (with beeps and stuff)

- [ ] Document what lights and beeps mean

- [ ] Email when alarm goes off

- [ ] Check todo list in the code too

NOTE: Design also works with RPi Zero

Getting the pack saves $8.45

I could get the pack and also get Jumper Wires for $3.95, I could get to tinkering earlier.

I could get the pack and get all the other products, $10.45 more expensive than just getting the pack.
